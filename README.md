# K-OS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/escortkeel/k-os.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/escortkeel/k-os)

An operating system written by Keeley Hoek as a hobby. It was inspired by Charlie Somerville's [JSOS](https://github.com/charliesome/JSOS).

K-OS aims to be a C kernel, but routines which need to be written in ASM are stored in separate files because large inline ASM blocks are ugly.

## Compiling
Currently K-OS accepts the following optional configuration options:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>CONFIG_OPTIMIZE</td>
        <td>Remove assorted bugcheck code which would otherwise make the system unnecessarily slower</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CONFIG_DEBUG_MM</td>
        <td>Enable particularly expensive MM-related bugchecks</td>
    </tr>
</table>
